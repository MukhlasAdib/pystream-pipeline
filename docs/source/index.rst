Welcome to PyStream's documentation!
=============================================

PyStream is package, fully implemented in Python, that helps you easily build and manage data pipeline and optimize its operation performance.
Since PyStream is focusing on improving data pipeline performance, this package is made for anyone who wants to build real time data processing application in Python.
PyStream does this by running your pipeline in managed multiple threads and/or processes (*to be added*), allowing several data to be processed at the same time.
This package will handle the threads and processes for you, so you only need to focus on writing your data processing codes.

Here are some examples:

- See `demo.ipynb <https://github.com/MukhlasAdib/pystream-pipeline/blob/main/demo.ipynb>`_ to get the quick start of PyStream.
- See how PyStream is used to increase the throughput of a vehicle environment mapping system in `this repository <https://github.com/MukhlasAdib/KITTI_Mapping/tree/main/app>`_.
